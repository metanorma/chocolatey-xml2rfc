== Repository purpose

This repository is for developing the official xml2rfc Chocolatey package.
End users should install xml2rfc directly from the official Chocolatey
repository using standard Chocolatey commands.

For end-user installation, see <<Installation from official repository>>.

xml2rfc is a tool used to process XML-based RFC documents into formats such as
plain text, HTML, or PDF. It is developed by the IETF and is essential for
RFC document generation and processing.

== Dependencies

The xml2rfc Chocolatey package has the following dependency:

* `python3` (version 3.0.1+)

When installing xml2rfc via Chocolatey, Python 3 is resolved automatically if
not already present on the system.

The package creates an isolated Python virtual environment for xml2rfc
installation to avoid conflicts with other Python packages.

== Installation from official repository

[source,shell]
----
choco install xml2rfc -y
----

or

[source,shell]
----
cinst xml2rfc -y
----

This installs xml2rfc from the official Chocolatey community repository.

== Installation from GitHub releases

For users who prefer to install directly from GitHub releases or need a
specific version not yet available in the official repository:

. Go to the https://github.com/metanorma/chocolatey-xml2rfc/releases[GitHub releases page]

. Find the desired release version (e.g., v3.30.0)

. Download the `.nupkg` file to your current working directory

. Install using local and official sources:
+
[source,shell]
----
choco install xml2rfc -dv -s "'.;chocolatey"
----

This method allows Chocolatey to find the local `.nupkg` file while still
resolving dependencies from the official repository.

Replace `3.30.0` with the desired version number in the filename.


== Using xml2rfc in Windows Docker containers

For developers building Windows Docker containers that need xml2rfc, you can
install either from the official Chocolatey repository or from local packages.

=== Method 1: Install from official Chocolatey repository

[source,dockerfile]
----
# Install Chocolatey (following the official method)
RUN Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; \
    [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = \
    [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; \
    iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString( \
    'https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

# Install xml2rfc from official Chocolatey
RUN choco install xml2rfc -y --no-progress

# Verify installation
RUN xml2rfc --version
----

=== Method 2: Install from local packages (recommended for CI/CD)

[source,dockerfile]
----
# Install Chocolatey (following the official method)
RUN Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; \
    [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = \
    [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; \
    iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString( \
    'https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

# Copy the .nupkg file to container
COPY xml2rfc.3.30.0.nupkg C:/packages/

# Enable global confirmation for Chocolatey commands
RUN choco feature enable -n allowGlobalConfirmation

# Install xml2rfc from local package with fallback to official repository
RUN choco install xml2rfc --source='C:\packages;chocolatey' -y --no-progress

# Verify installation
RUN xml2rfc --version
----

The xml2rfc package will automatically install Python 3 if not already present.

[example]
====
The package creates a virtual environment at `%ChocolateyInstall%\lib\xml2rfc`
and registers the xml2rfc executable in the system PATH for global access.
====

== Modifying the package

. Edit the `xml2rfc.nuspec` configuration file.
. Edit the `./tools/chocolateyInstall.ps1` install script
. Edit the `./tools/chocolateyUninstall.ps1` uninstall script
. You **must** save your files with *UTF-8* character encoding without BOM.

== Building the package

* Run `choco pack` in the same directory as `xml2rfc.nuspec`

NOTE: If you are running this from a command prompt/Powershell prompt, you must
run it "`as Administrator`".

== Testing the package

=== Automated testing

The repository includes GitHub Actions workflows that automatically test the
package:

* Build and pack the `.nupkg` file
* Install the package with dependencies
* Verify xml2rfc functionality
* Test uninstallation

The workflows run on every push and pull request to ensure package integrity.

=== Manual testing

NOTE: Manual testing should be done on a Virtual Machine (See:
https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment).

In the package directory, use:

* `choco install xml2rfc -dv -s "'$pwd;https://chocolatey.org/api/v2/'" -f` (Powershell)
* `choco install xml2rfc -dv -s "'%cd%;https://chocolatey.org/api/v2/'" -f` (everywhere else)

Or, use the full path:

* `choco install xml2rfc --source 'c:\path\to\package;chocolatey' -f`

NOTE: It is important to include the Chocolatey source in the source list to
ensure remote dependencies can be resolved, otherwise Chocolatey will only
attempt to resolve dependencies locally.

After executing the install, ensure that `xml2rfc.exe` is installed by
executing the following command from the command prompt:

[source,shell]
----
xml2rfc --version
----

If it is properly installed, you will see the current version of xml2rfc.

=== Testing uninstallation

NOTE: The Chocolatey install path on Windows is typically `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey`

Execute the following command to uninstall xml2rfc.

[source,shell]
----
choco uninstall xml2rfc -y
----

After executing the uninstall ensure that `xml2rfc` is not found in the
Chocolatey install path.

You can also try running `xml2rfc --version` from the command-line to see if it
is still installed.

== Automation

This repository includes automated workflows for package maintenance:

=== Auto-update workflow

* Runs daily at 6:00 AM UTC
* Checks for new xml2rfc releases from the upstream repository
* Automatically updates package files and creates releases
* Can be triggered manually with optional auto-release toggle

=== Main workflow

* Builds and tests the package on every push
* Publishes to Chocolatey.org and GitHub releases when tags are created
* Ensures package quality through automated testing

The automation ensures the xml2rfc Chocolatey package stays current with
upstream releases without manual intervention.

== Publish the package to the Chocolatey community feed repository

[source,shell]
----
choco apikey -k [API_KEY_HERE] -source https://chocolatey.org/

# package name can be omitted below
choco push xml2rfc.[version num].nupkg -s https://chocolatey.org/
----
